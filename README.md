This repository is created with the purpose that anyone can create their own photogametry base from arduino

The base of this project is taken from a project already started which is linked to this: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3958326

But the functionality of taking the photo through a bluetooth device with the native application of the mobile phone has been added.

With the HC-06 bluetooth module that had to be flashed to end up simulating a RN-42 bluetooth device by firmware which had the necessary functions for the project that was wanted to be carried out. The link that shows how to flash said device is as follows:

You have to make sure that the processor that carries the bluetooth device is the B417 because many are sold with the B317 processor and this is not valid for the project.

Everything necessary to carry out the flashing is in the lorf colleague's github repository, this being the link:

Below are the links of some videos with the demonstration of the functionalities that the project has:

This project only works with android devices.
